Nie, Q., Wang, J., Wang, X. and Liu, Y., 2019. View-Invariant Human Action Recognition Based on a 3D Bio-Constrained Skeleton Model. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28(8), pp.3959-3972. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8672922

The code in this repository was written by Qiang Nie.

In this repository, we provide some results we achieved and the code we used. As the code for motion visualization related to a patent, we can only offer a partial of it. However, we share some generated motion images for the action recognition and the . Readers are also suggested to reproduce this part according to our paper.

Currently, only a C++ version of the motion visualization code is provided for a reference.

## Dependencies
* Dlib
* Kinect library
* tensorflow 1.11 or later
